### Quality of life
- Profiles: Tools → Profiles
    - Create, switch, rename, and delete profiles (default cannot be deleted).
    - All settings (including hotkeys and player stats) are scoped to the active profile and saved to `%APPDATA%\Cunny\config.<profile>.json`.
- Hotkeys per feature
    - Each cheat row shows “Add Hotkey” and “Reset”. Click Add Hotkey, press any key to bind; Reset removes it for that cheat.
    - Hotkeys are profile-specific and persist automatically.
- Timescale
    - Type an exact value into the input box next to the slider (clamped 0.10–10.00).
